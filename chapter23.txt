# 23 프로토콜 (Protocols)
> Translator : 이름 (메일주소)

A protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a
particular task or piece of functionality. The protocol doesn’t actually provide an
implementation for any of these requirements—it only describes what an implementation
will look like. The protocol can then be adopted by a class, structure, or enumeration to
provide an actual implementation of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the
requirements of a protocol is said to conform to that protocol.
프로토콜은 특정 작업이나 기능에 부합하는 메소드, 속성, 그리고 다른 요구사항들에 대한 청사진과 같습니다. 프로토콜에는 이런 요구사항들에 대한 어떤 구현도 포함하지 않고, 다만 구현된 모습이 어떨지 윤곽만 드러납니다. 그러면 클래스, 구조체나 열거형에서 프로토콜을 따라 요구사항들을 실제로 구현하게 됩니다. 프로토콜의 요구사항을 만족하는 형(`type`)이라면 그 프로토콜에 들어맞다(conform)라고 하죠.

Protocols can require that conforming types have specific instance properties, instance
methods, type methods, operators, and subscripts.
Protocol Syntax
You define protocols in a very similar way to classes, structures, and enumerations:
protocol SomeProtocol {
// protocol definition goes here
}
Custom types state that they adopt a particular protocol by placing the protocol’s name
after the type’s name, separated by a colon, as part of their definition. Multiple protocols
can be listed, and are separated by commas:
struct SomeStructure: FirstProtocol, AnotherProtocol {
// structure definition goes here
}
If a class has a superclass, list the superclass name before any protocols it adopts,
followed by a comma:
class SomeClass: SomeSuperclass, FirstProtocol, AnotherProtocol {
// class definition goes here
}
Property Requirements
A protocol can require any conforming type to provide an instance property or type
property with a particular name and type. The protocol doesn’t specify whether the
property should be a stored property or a computed property—it only specifies the
required property name and type. The protocol also specifies whether each property must
be gettable or gettable and settable.
If a protocol requires a property to be gettable and settable, that property requirement
cannot be fulfilled by a constant stored property or a read-only computed property. If the
protocol only requires a property to be gettable, the requirement can be satisfied by any
kind of property, and it is valid for it also to be settable if this is useful for your own code.
Property requirements are always declared as variable properties, prefixed with the var
keyword. Gettable and settable properties are indicated by writing { get set } after their
type declaration, and gettable properties are indicated by writing { get }.
protocol SomeProtocol {
var mustBeSettable: Int { get set }
var doesNotNeedToBeSettable: Int { get }
}
Always prefix type property requirements with the class keyword when you define them in
a protocol. This is true even though type property requirements are prefixed with the static
keyword when implemented by a structure or enumeration:
protocol AnotherProtocol {
class var someTypeProperty: Int { get set }
}
Here’s an example of a protocol with a single instance property requirement:
protocol FullyNamed {
var fullName: String { get }
}
The FullyNamed protocol defines any kind of thing that has a fully-qualified name. It doesn’t
specify what kind of thing it must be—it only specifies that the thing must be able to
provide a full name for itself. It specifies this requirement by stating that any FullyNamed
type must have a gettable instance property called fullName, which is of type String.
Here’s an example of a simple structure that adopts and conforms to the FullyNamed
protocol:
struct Person: FullyNamed {
var fullName: String
}
let john = Person(fullName: "John Appleseed")
// john.fullName is "John Appleseed"
This example defines a structure called Person, which represents a specific named person.
It states that it adopts the FullyNamed protocol as part of the first line of its definition.
Each instance of Person has a single stored property called fullName, which is of type String.
This matches the single requirement of the FullyNamed protocol, and means that Person has
correctly conformed to the protocol. (Swift reports an error at compile-time if a protocol
requirement is not fulfilled.)
Here’s a more complex class, which also adopts and conforms to the FullyNamed protocol:
class Starship: FullyNamed {
var prefix: String?
var name: String
init(name: String, prefix: String? = nil) {
self.name = name
self.prefix = prefix
}
var fullName: String {
return (prefix ? prefix! + " " : "") + name
ncc1701 = Starship(name: "Enterprise", prefix: "USS")
ncc1701.fullName is "USS Enterprise"
This class implements the fullName property requirement as a computed read-only property
for a starship. Each Starship class instance stores a mandatory name and an optional prefix.
The fullName property uses the prefix value if it exists, and prepends it to the beginning of
name to create a full name for the starship.
Method Requirements
Protocols can require specific instance methods and type methods to be implemented by
conforming types. These methods are written as part of the protocol’s definition in exactly
the same way as for normal instance and type methods, but without curly braces or a
method body. Variadic parameters are allowed, subject to the same rules as for normal
methods.
N O T E
Protocols use the same syntax as normal methods, but are not allowed to specify default values for method
parameters.
As with type property requirements, you always prefix type method requirements with the
class keyword when they are defined in a protocol. This is true even though type method
requirements are prefixed with the static keyword when implemented by a structure or
enumeration:
protocol SomeProtocol {
class func someTypeMethod()
}
The following example defines a protocol with a single instance method requirement:
protocol RandomNumberGenerator {
func random() -> Double
}
This protocol, RandomNumberGenerator, requires any conforming type to have an instance
method called random, which returns a Double value whenever it is called. (Although it is not
specified as part of the protocol, it is assumed that this value will be a number between
0.0 and 1.0 inclusive.)
The RandomNumberGenerator protocol does not make any assumptions about how each random
number will be generated—it simply requires the generator to provide a standard way to
generate a new random number.
Here’s an implementation of a class that adopts and conforms to the RandomNumberGenerator
protocol. This class implements a pseudorandom number generator algorithm known as a
linear congruential generator:
class LinearCongruentialGenerator: RandomNumberGenerator {
var lastRandom = 42.0
let m = 139968.0
let a = 3877.0
let c = 29573.0
func random() -> Double {
lastRandom = ((lastRandom * a + c) % m)
return lastRandom / m
}
generator = LinearCongruentialGenerator()
("Here's a random number: \(generator.random())")
prints "Here's a random number: 0.37464991998171"
("And another one: \(generator.random())")
prints "And another one: 0.729023776863283"
Mutating Method Requirements
It is sometimes necessary for a method to modify (or mutate) the instance it belongs to.
For instance methods on value types (that is, structures and enumerations) you place the
mutating keyword before a method’s func keyword to indicate that the method is allowed to
modify the instance it belongs to and/or any properties of that instance. This process is
described in Modifying Value Types from Within Instance Methods.
If you define a protocol instance method requirement that is intended to mutate
instances of any type that adopts the protocol, mark the method with the mutating keyword
as part of the protocol’s definition. This enables structures and enumerations to adopt the
protocol and satisfy that method requirement.
N O T E
If you mark a protocol instance method requirement as mutating, you do not need to write the mutating
keyword when writing an implementation of that method for a class. The mutating keyword is only used by
structures and enumerations.
The example below defines a protocol called Togglable, which defines a single instance
method requirement called toggle. As its name suggests, the toggle method is intended to
toggle or invert the state of any conforming type, typically by modifying a property of that
type.
The toggle method is marked with the mutating keyword as part of the Togglable protocol
definition, to indicate that the method is expected to mutate the state of a conforming
instance when it is called:
protocol Togglable {
mutating func toggle()
}
If you implement the Togglable protocol for a structure or enumeration, that structure or
enumeration can conform to the protocol by providing an implementation of the toggle
method that is also marked as mutating.
The example below defines an enumeration called OnOffSwitch. This enumeration toggles
between two states, indicated by the enumeration cases On and Off. The enumeration’s
toggle implementation is marked as mutating, to match the Togglable protocol’s requirements:
enum OnOffSwitch: Togglable {
case Off, On
mutating func toggle() {
switch self {
case Off:
self = On
case On:
self = Off
}
lightSwitch = OnOffSwitch.Off
lightSwitch.toggle()
lightSwitch is now equal to .On
Protocols as Types
Protocols do not actually implement any functionality themselves. Nonetheless, any
protocol you create will become a fully-fledged type for use in your code.
Because it is a type, you can use a protocol in many places where other types are
allowed, including:
N O T E
Because protocols are types, begin their names with a capital letter (such as FullyNamed and
RandomNumberGenerator) to match the names of other types in Swift (such as Int, String, and Double).
Here’s an example of a protocol used as a type:
class Dice {
let sides: Int
let generator: RandomNumberGenerator
init(sides: Int, generator: RandomNumberGenerator) {
self.sides = sides
self.generator = generator
}
func roll() -> Int {
return Int(generator.random() * Double(sides)) + 1
This example defines a new class called Dice, which represents an n-sided dice for use in a
board game. Dice instances have an integer property called sides, which represents how
many sides they have, and a property called generator, which provides a random number
generator from which to create dice roll values.
As a parameter type or return type in a function, method, or initializer
As the type of a constant, variable, or property
As the type of items in an array, dictionary, or other container
The generator property is of type RandomNumberGenerator. Therefore, you can set it to an
instance of any type that adopts the RandomNumberGenerator protocol. Nothing else is required
of the instance you assign to this property, except that the instance must adopt the
RandomNumberGenerator protocol.
Dice also has an initializer, to set up its initial state. This initializer has a parameter called
generator, which is also of type RandomNumberGenerator. You can pass a value of any conforming
type in to this parameter when initializing a new Dice instance.
Dice provides one instance method, roll, which returns an integer value between 1 and the
number of sides on the dice. This method calls the generator’s random method to create a
new random number between 0.0 and 1.0, and uses this random number to create a dice
roll value within the correct range. Because generator is known to adopt RandomNumberGenerator,
it is guaranteed to have a random method to call.
Here’s how the Dice class can be used to create a six-sided dice with a
LinearCongruentialGenerator instance as its random number generator:
var d6 = Dice(sides: 6, generator: LinearCongruentialGenerator())
for _ in 1...5 {
println("Random dice roll is \(d6.roll())")
}
// Random dice roll is 3
// Random dice roll is 5
// Random dice roll is 4
// Random dice roll is 5
// Random dice roll is 4
Delegation
Delegation is a design pattern that enables a class or structure to hand off (or delegate)
some of its responsibilities to an instance of another type. This design pattern is
implemented by defining a protocol that encapsulates the delegated responsibilities, such
that a conforming type (known as a delegate) is guaranteed to provide the functionality
that has been delegated. Delegation can be used to respond to a particular action, or to
retrieve data from an external source without needing to know the underlying type of that
source.
The example below defines two protocols for use with dice-based board games:
protocol DiceGame {
var dice: Dice { get }
func play()
}
protocol DiceGameDelegate {
func gameDidStart(game: DiceGame)
func game(game: DiceGame, didStartNewTurnWithDiceRoll diceRoll: Int)
func gameDidEnd(game: DiceGame)
}
The DiceGame protocol is a protocol that can be adopted by any game that involves dice.
The DiceGameDelegate protocol can be adopted by any type to track the progress of a DiceGame.
Here’s a version of the Snakes and Ladders game originally introduced in Control Flow.
This version is adapted to use a Dice instance for its dice-rolls; to adopt the DiceGame
protocol; and to notify a DiceGameDelegate about its progress:
class SnakesAndLadders: DiceGame {
let finalSquare = 25
let dice = Dice(sides: 6, generator: LinearCongruentialGenerator())
var square = 0
var board: Int[]
init() {
board = Int[](count: finalSquare + 1, repeatedValue: 0)
board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08
var delegate: DiceGameDelegate?
func play() {
square = 0
delegate?.gameDidStart(self)
gameLoop: while square != finalSquare {
let diceRoll = dice.roll()
delegate?.game(self, didStartNewTurnWithDiceRoll: diceRoll)
switch square + diceRoll {
case finalSquare:
break gameLoop
case let newSquare where newSquare > finalSquare:
continue gameLoop
default:
square += diceRoll
square += board[square]
}
}
delegate?.gameDidEnd(self)
For a description of the Snakes and Ladders gameplay, see the Break section of the
Control Flow chapter.
This version of the game is wrapped up as a class called SnakesAndLadders, which adopts the
DiceGame protocol. It provides a gettable dice property and a play method in order to conform
to the protocol. (The dice property is declared as a constant property because it does not
need to change after initialization, and the protocol only requires that it is gettable.)
The Snakes and Ladders game board setup takes place within the class’s init() initializer.
All game logic is moved into the protocol’s play method, which uses the protocol’s required
dice property to provide its dice roll values.
Note that the delegate property is defined as an optional DiceGameDelegate, because a delegate
isn’t required in order to play the game. Because it is of an optional type, the delegate
property is automatically set to an initial value of nil. Thereafter, the game instantiator has
the option to set the property to a suitable delegate.
DiceGameDelegate provides three methods for tracking the progress of a game. These three
methods have been incorporated into the game logic within the play method above, and
are called when a new game starts, a new turn begins, or the game ends.
Because the delegate property is an optional DiceGameDelegate, the play method uses optional
chaining each time it calls a method on the delegate. If the delegate property is nil, these
delegate calls fail gracefully and without error. If the delegate property is non-nil, the
delegate methods are called, and are passed the SnakesAndLadders instance as a parameter.
This next example shows a class called DiceGameTracker, which adopts the DiceGameDelegate
protocol:
class DiceGameTracker: DiceGameDelegate {
var numberOfTurns = 0
func gameDidStart(game: DiceGame) {
numberOfTurns = 0
if game is SnakesAndLadders {
println("Started a new game of Snakes and Ladders")
}
println("The game is using a \(game.dice.sides)-sided dice")
}
func game(game: DiceGame, didStartNewTurnWithDiceRoll diceRoll: Int) {
++numberOfTurns
println("Rolled a \(diceRoll)")
func gameDidEnd(game: DiceGame) {
println("The game lasted for \(numberOfTurns) turns")
DiceGameTracker implements all three methods required by DiceGameDelegate. It uses these
methods to keep track of the number of turns a game has taken. It resets a numberOfTurns
property to zero when the game starts; increments it each time a new turn begins; and
prints out the total number of turns once the game has ended.
The implementation of gameDidStart shown above uses the game parameter to print some
introductory information about the game that is about to be played. The game parameter
has a type of DiceGame, not SnakesAndLadders, and so gameDidStart can access and use only
methods and properties that are implemented as part of the DiceGame protocol. However,
the method is still able to use type casting to query the type of the underlying instance.
In this example, it checks whether game is actually an instance of SnakesAndLadders behind the
scenes, and prints an appropriate message if so.
gameDidStart also accesses the dice property of the passed game parameter. Because game is
known to conform to the DiceGame protocol, it is guaranteed to have a dice property, and so
the gameDidStart method is able to access and print the dice’s sides property, regardless of
what kind of game is being played.
Here’s how DiceGameTracker looks in action:
let tracker = DiceGameTracker()
let game = SnakesAndLadders()
game.delegate = tracker
game.play()
// Started a new game of Snakes and Ladders
// The game is using a 6-sided dice
// Rolled a 3
// Rolled a 5
// Rolled a 4
Rolled a 5
The game lasted for 4 turns
Adding Protocol Conformance with an Extension
You can extend an existing type to adopt and conform to a new protocol, even if you do
not have access to the source code for the existing type. Extensions can add new
properties, methods, and subscripts to an existing type, and are therefore able to add any
requirements that a protocol may demand. For more about extensions, see Extensions.
N O T E
Existing instances of a type automatically adopt and conform to a protocol when that conformance is added to
the instance’s type in an extension.
For example, this protocol, called TextRepresentable, can be implemented by any type that
has a way to be represented as text. This might be a description of itself, or a text
version of its current state:
protocol TextRepresentable {
func asText() -> String
}
The Dice class from earlier can be extended to adopt and conform to TextRepresentable:
extension Dice: TextRepresentable {
func asText() -> String {
return "A \(sides)-sided dice"
}
}
This extension adopts the new protocol in exactly the same way as if Dice had provided it
in its original implementation. The protocol name is provided after the type name,
separated by a colon, and an implementation of all requirements of the protocol is
provided within the extension’s curly braces.
Any Dice instance can now be treated as TextRepresentable:
let d12 = Dice(sides: 12, generator: LinearCongruentialGenerator())
println(d12.asText())
// prints "A 12-sided dice"
Similarly, the SnakesAndLadders game class can be extended to adopt and conform to the
TextRepresentable protocol:
extension SnakesAndLadders: TextRepresentable {
func asText() -> String {
return "A game of Snakes and Ladders with \(finalSquare) squares"
}
}
println(game.asText())
// prints "A game of Snakes and Ladders with 25 squares"
Declaring Protocol Adoption with an Extension
If a type already conforms to all of the requirements of a protocol, but has not yet stated
that it adopts that protocol, you can make it adopt the protocol with an empty extension:
struct Hamster {
var name: String
func asText() -> String {
return "A hamster named \(name)"
}
}
extension Hamster: TextRepresentable {}
Instances of Hamster can now be used wherever TextRepresentable is the required type:
let simonTheHamster = Hamster(name: "Simon")
let somethingTextRepresentable: TextRepresentable = simonTheHamster
println(somethingTextRepresentable.asText())
// prints "A hamster named Simon"
N O T E
Types do not automatically adopt a protocol just by satisfying its requirements. They must always explicitly
declare their adoption of the protocol.
Collections of Protocol Types
A protocol can be used as the type to be stored in a collection such as an array or a
dictionary, as mentioned in Protocols as Types. This example creates an array of
TextRepresentable things:
let things: TextRepresentable[] = [game, d12, simonTheHamster]
It is now possible to iterate over the items in the array, and print each item’s textual
representation:
for thing in things {
println(thing.asText())
}
// A game of Snakes and Ladders with 25 squares
// A 12-sided dice
// A hamster named Simon
Note that the thing constant is of type TextRepresentable. It is not of type Dice, or DiceGame, or
Hamster, even if the actual instance behind the scenes is of one of those types.
Nonetheless, because it is of type TextRepresentable, and anything that is TextRepresentable is
known to have an asText method, it is safe to call thing.asText each time through the loop.
Protocol Inheritance
A protocol can inherit one or more other protocols and can add further requirements on
top of the requirements it inherits. The syntax for protocol inheritance is similar to the
syntax for class inheritance, but with the option to list multiple inherited protocols,
separated by commas:
protocol InheritingProtocol: SomeProtocol, AnotherProtocol {
// protocol definition goes here
}
Here’s an example of a protocol that inherits the TextRepresentable protocol from above:
protocol PrettyTextRepresentable: TextRepresentable {
func asPrettyText() -> String
}
This example defines a new protocol, PrettyTextRepresentable, which inherits from
TextRepresentable. Anything that adopts PrettyTextRepresentable must satisfy all of the
requirements enforced by TextRepresentable, plus the additional requirements enforced by
PrettyTextRepresentable. In this example, PrettyTextRepresentable adds a single requirement to
provide an instance method called asPrettyText that returns a String.
The SnakesAndLadders class can be extended to adopt and conform to PrettyTextRepresentable:
extension SnakesAndLadders: PrettyTextRepresentable {
func asPrettyText() -> String {
var output = asText() + ":\n"
for index in 1...finalSquare {
switch board[index] {
case let ladder where ladder > 0:
output += "▲ "
case let snake where snake < 0:
output += "▼ "
default:
output += "○ "
}
}
return output
This extension states that it adopts the PrettyTextRepresentable protocol and provides an
implementation of the asPrettyText method for the SnakesAndLadders type. Anything that is
PrettyTextRepresentable must also be TextRepresentable, and so the asPrettyText implementation
starts by calling the asText method from the TextRepresentable protocol to begin an output
string. It appends a colon and a line break, and uses this as the start of its pretty text
representation. It then iterates through the array of board squares, and appends an emoji
representation for each square:
The method implementation can now be used to print a pretty text description of any
SnakesAndLadders instance:
println(game.asPrettyText())
// A game of Snakes and Ladders with 25 squares:
// ○ ○ ▲ ○ ○ ▲ ○ ○ ▲ ▲ ○ ○ ○ ▼ ○ ○ ○ ○ ▼ ○ ○ ▼ ○ ▼ ○
If the square’s value is greater than 0, it is the base of a ladder, and is
represented by ▲.
If the square’s value is less than 0, it is the head of a snake, and is represented by
▼.
Otherwise, the square’s value is 0, and it is a “free” square, represented by ○.
Protocol Composition
It can be useful to require a type to conform to multiple protocols at once. You can
combine multiple protocols into a single requirement with a protocol composition.
Protocol compositions have the form protocol<SomeProtocol, AnotherProtocol>. You can list as many
protocols within the pair of angle brackets (<>) as you need, separated by commas.
Here’s an example that combines two protocols called Named and Aged into a single
protocol composition requirement on a function parameter:
protocol Named {
var name: String { get }
}
protocol Aged {
var age: Int { get }
}
struct Person: Named, Aged {
var name: String
var age: Int
wishHappyBirthday(celebrator: protocol<Named, Aged>) {
println("Happy birthday \(celebrator.name) - you're \(celebrator.age)!")
birthdayPerson = Person(name: "Malcolm", age: 21)
wishHappyBirthday(birthdayPerson)
prints "Happy birthday Malcolm - you're 21!"
This example defines a protocol called Named, with a single requirement for a gettable String
property called name. It also defines a protocol called Aged, with a single requirement for a
gettable Int property called age. Both of these protocols are adopted by a structure called
Person.
The example also defines a function called wishHappyBirthday, which takes a single parameter
called celebrator. The type of this parameter is protocol<Named, Aged>, which means “any type
that conforms to both the Named and Aged protocols.” It doesn’t matter what specific type is
passed to the function, as long as it conforms to both of the required protocols.
The example then creates a new Person instance called birthdayPerson and passes this new
instance to the wishHappyBirthday function. Because Person conforms to both protocols, this is a
valid call, and the wishHappyBirthday function is able to print its birthday greeting.
N O T E
Protocol compositions do not define a new, permanent protocol type. Rather, they define a temporary local
protocol that has the combined requirements of all protocols in the composition.
Checking for Protocol Conformance
You can use the is and as operators described in Type Casting to check for protocol
conformance, and to cast to a specific protocol. Checking for and casting to a protocol
follows exactly the same syntax as checking for and casting to a type:
This example defines a protocol called HasArea, with a single property requirement of a
gettable Double property called area:
@objc protocol HasArea {
var area: Double { get }
}
N O T E
You can check for protocol conformance only if your protocol is marked with the @objc attribute, as seen for
the HasArea protocol above. This attribute indicates that the protocol should be exposed to Objective-C code
and is described in Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C. Even if you are not interoperating with Objective-C,
you need to mark your protocols with the @objc attribute if you want to be able to check for protocol
conformance.
Note also that @objc protocols can be adopted only by classes, and not by structures or enumerations. If you
mark your protocol as @objc in order to check for conformance, you will be able to apply that protocol only to
class types.
The is operator returns true if an instance conforms to a protocol and returns false if
it does not.
The as? version of the downcast operator returns an optional value of the
protocol’s type, and this value is nil if the instance does not conform to that
protocol.
The as version of the downcast operator forces the downcast to the protocol type
and triggers a runtime error if the downcast does not succeed.
Here are two classes, Circle and Country, both of which conform to the HasArea protocol:
class Circle: HasArea {
let pi = 3.1415927
var radius: Double
var area: Double { return pi * radius * radius }
init(radius: Double) { self.radius = radius }
}
class Country: HasArea {
var area: Double
init(area: Double) { self.area = area }
The Circle class implements the area property requirement as a computed property, based
on a stored radius property. The Country class implements the area requirement directly as a
stored property. Both classes correctly conform to the HasArea protocol.
Here’s a class called Animal, which does not conform to the HasArea protocol:
class Animal {
var legs: Int
init(legs: Int) { self.legs = legs }
}
The Circle, Country and Animal classes do not have a shared base class. Nonetheless, they are
all classes, and so instances of all three types can be used to initialize an array that
stores values of type AnyObject:
let objects: AnyObject[] = [
Circle(radius: 2.0),
Country(area: 243_610),
Animal(legs: 4)
]
The objects array is initialized with an array literal containing a Circle instance with a radius
of 2 units; a Country instance initialized with the surface area of the United Kingdom in
square kilometers; and an Animal instance with four legs.
The objects array can now be iterated, and each object in the array can be checked to see
if it conforms to the HasArea protocol:
for object in objects {
if let objectWithArea = object as? HasArea {
println("Area is \(objectWithArea.area)")
} else {
println("Something that doesn't have an area")
}
}
// Area is 12.5663708
// Area is 243610.0
Something that doesn't have an area
Whenever an object in the array conforms to the HasArea protocol, the optional value
returned by the as? operator is unwrapped with optional binding into a constant called
objectWithArea. The objectWithArea constant is known to be of type HasArea, and so its area
property can be accessed and printed in a type-safe way.
Note that the underlying objects are not changed by the casting process. They continue
to be a Circle, a Country and an Animal. However, at the point that they are stored in the
objectWithArea constant, they are only known to be of type HasArea, and so only their area
property can be accessed.
Optional Protocol Requirements
You can define optional requirements for protocols, These requirements do not have to
be implemented by types that conform to the protocol. Optional requirements are
prefixed by the @optional keyword as part of the protocol’s definition.
An optional protocol requirement can be called with optional chaining, to account for the
possibility that the requirement was not implemented by a type that conforms to the
protocol. For information on optional chaining, see Optional Chaining.
You check for an implementation of an optional requirement by writing a question mark
after the name of the requirement when it is called, such as someOptionalMethod?(someArgument).
Optional property requirements, and optional method requirements that return a value,
will always return an optional value of the appropriate type when they are accessed or
called, to reflect the fact that the optional requirement may not have been implemented.
N O T E
Optional protocol requirements can only be specified if your protocol is marked with the @objc attribute. Even if
you are not interoperating with Objective-C, you need to mark your protocols with the @objc attribute if you
want to specify optional requirements.
Note also that @objc protocols can be adopted only by classes, and not by structures or enumerations. If you
mark your protocol as @objc in order to specify optional requirements, you will only be able to apply that
protocol to class types.
The following example defines an integer-counting class called Counter, which uses an
external data source to provide its increment amount. This data source is defined by the
CounterDataSource protocol, which has two optional requirements:
@objc protocol CounterDataSource {
@optional func incrementForCount(count: Int) -> Int
@optional var fixedIncrement: Int { get }
}
The CounterDataSource protocol defines an optional method requirement called incrementForCount
and an optional property requirement called fixedIncrement. These requirements define two
different ways for data sources to provide an appropriate increment amount for a Counter
instance.
N O T E
Strictly speaking, you can write a custom class that conforms to CounterDataSource without implementing
either protocol requirement. They are both optional, after all. Although technically allowed, this wouldn’t make
for a very good data source.
The Counter class, defined below, has an optional dataSource property of type CounterDataSource?:
@objc class Counter {
var count = 0
var dataSource: CounterDataSource?
func increment() {
if let amount = dataSource?.incrementForCount?(count) {
count += amount
} else if let amount = dataSource?.fixedIncrement? {
count += amount
}
The Counter class stores its current value in a variable property called count. The Counter class
also defines a method called increment, which increments the count property every time the
method is called.
The increment method first tries to retrieve an increment amount by looking for an
implementation of the incrementForCount method on its data source. The increment method uses
optional chaining to try to call incrementForCount, and passes the current count value as the
method’s single argument.
Note two levels of optional chaining at play here. Firstly, it is possible that dataSource may
be nil, and so dataSource has a question mark after its name to indicate that incrementForCount
should only be called if dataSource is non-nil. Secondly, even if dataSource does exist, there is
no guarantee that it implements incrementForCount, because it is an optional requirement.
This is why incrementForCount is also written with a question mark after its name.
Because the call to incrementForCount can fail for either of these two reasons, the call returns
an optional Int value. This is true even though incrementForCount is defined as returning a nonoptional
Int value in the definition of CounterDataSource.
After calling incrementForCount, the optional Int that it returns is unwrapped into a constant
called amount, using optional binding. If the optional Int does contain a value—that is, if the
delegate and method both exist, and the method returned a value—the unwrapped amount
is added onto the stored count property, and incrementation is complete.
If it is not possible to retrieve a value from the incrementForCount method—either because
dataSource is nil, or because the data source does not implement incrementForCount—then the
increment method tries to retrieve a value from the data source’s fixedIncrement property
instead. The fixedIncrement property is also an optional requirement, and so its name is also
written using optional chaining with a question mark on the end, to indicate that the
attempt to access the property’s value can fail. As before, the returned value is an
optional Int value, even though fixedIncrement is defined as a non-optional Int property as
part of the CounterDataSource protocol definition.
Here’s a simple CounterDataSource implementation where the data source returns a constant
value of 3 every time it is queried. It does this by implementing the optional fixedIncrement
property requirement:
class ThreeSource: CounterDataSource {
let fixedIncrement = 3
}
You can use an instance of ThreeSource as the data source for a new Counter instance:
var counter = Counter()
counter.dataSource = ThreeSource()
for _ in 1...4 {
counter.increment()
println(counter.count)
}
// 3
// 6
// 9
The code above creates a new Counter instance; sets its data source to be a new ThreeSource
instance; and calls the counter’s increment method four times. As expected, the counter’s
count property increases by three each time increment is called.
Here’s a more complex data source called TowardsZeroSource, which makes a Counter instance
count up or down towards zero from its current count value:
class TowardsZeroSource: CounterDataSource {
func incrementForCount(count: Int) -> Int {
if count == 0 {
return 0
} else if count < 0 {
return 1
} else {
return -1
}
The TowardsZeroSource class implements the optional incrementForCount method from the
CounterDataSource protocol and uses the count argument value to work out which direction to
count in. If count is already zero, the method returns 0 to indicate that no further counting
should take place.
You can use an instance of TowardsZeroSource with the existing Counter instance to count from -
4 to zero. Once the counter reaches zero, no more counting takes place:
counter.count = -4
counter.dataSource = TowardsZeroSource()
for _ in 1...5 {
counter.increment()
println(counter.count)
}
// -3
// -2
// -1
